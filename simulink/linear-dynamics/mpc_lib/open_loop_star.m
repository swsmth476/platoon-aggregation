% Open loop controller to be called by closed loop MPC

%%% Description %%%
% STL formula encoded is:
%
% phi_mpc = phi ^ (signal ==> eventually_[0,H] psi)
%
% where phi encodes safety and input constraints
% and psi encodes velocity constraints 
% (forcing the platoon to accelerate when signal goes high)
